## VPD Money

**Android Developer Assessment Task**

This is a sample fintech Android app that demonstrates the key functionalities relevant to fintech services. It simulates the transfer of money between different accounts on the app.

What you'll need to run this:

*   A computer running Android Studio
*   A stable internet question
*   An Android device or Android emulator (preferably the one which ships with android studio)
*   About 5-10 minutes (depending on the speed of your setup)  
    Â 

## How to Run

First you need to clone the repo/codebase on github either by zip or by cloning it via terminal.

*   If you download the codebase zip, extract it to your working directory
*   If you're going via terminal just `cd` into your working directory then run the command `git clone` [`https://github.com/josephdalughut/vpd-test-results.git`](https://github.com/josephdalughut/vpd-test-results.git) and wait for it to clone
*   Open up your Android Studio and navigate to the project directory which would be named **vpd-test-results** and open it on Android studio
*   Wait for a couple of minutes so that dependencies are downloaded and the code is built  
    \- If you use a device for development you can plug it in so you can use it to run the project
*   Once the project is completely built, you can now run it.

**Relevant notes**  
Sometimes the app login might fail on an Emulator and this has been a known issue with regards to firebaseAuth and the emulator, so it might be best to work with an actual Android device to test.

Thanks and happy testing!
